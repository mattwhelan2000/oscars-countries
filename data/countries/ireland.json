  "history": "Ireland's history stretches from prehistoric hunter-gatherers to the formation of the modern Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, which remains in the UK. Key periods include the Celtic Iron Age, the arrival of Christianity with St. Patrick, Viking invasions that established towns, and the Anglo-Norman invasion that began a long period of English dominance. The Great Famine in the 1840s devastated the population, and the early 20th century saw the Irish War of Independence, leading to the partition of the island in 1921 and the creation of the Irish Free State (now the Republic of Ireland) and Northern Ireland within the UK.",
